# DynamicSpawn
Adds Species to spawn in vanilla maps.  Run `replace.ps1` to change the values.  No policy change is required.
* First value is to replace stuff like the space ships and space station.
* The second value is used in cultist and space labs.

Reset to default values with `reset.ps1`.

# Bugs
Do __not__ leave any spaces blank!

Do __not__ set both values to the same thing (Although this might be imposible)
